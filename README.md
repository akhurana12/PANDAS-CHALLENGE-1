# PANDAS-CHALLENGE
 
As the new Chief Data Scientist for the city's school district I'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, I've analyzed the district-wide standardized test results with access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. The data collected has been aggregated to showcase trends in school performance.
